1.State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)

-software:manages the database and allows users to interact with it. -hardware:they physical infrasture of a computer system. -data:stored in database. -procedures:govern how the DBMS is designed and used.gir

2.What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.

-A relational database organizes data into tables, where each row represents a record and each column represents an attribute. The tables are related to each other through common columns.

Examples of Relational Databases

-MySQL -PostgreSQL -Microsoft SQL Server -Oracle

3.State and Explain three classifications of SQL?

-SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to interact with relational databases. It is classified into three main types:

-DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to create, modify, or delete database objects (e.g., tables, columns). -DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to insert, update, or delete data in the database. -DCL (Data Control Language): Used to grant or revoke user permissions and roles.

4.What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?

-Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. -Foreign Key: A column in one table that references a primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

5.What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?

-An ERD is a graphical representation of the relationships between entities (real-world objects) in a database. It helps visualize and design the structure of the database.

6.What are the advantages of relational databases?

-Data consistency due to structured organization. -Data independence, allowing changes to underlying structure without affecting application logic. -Support for complex queries and data manipulation. -Scalability and high availability options.

7.State four types of data type used to store data in tables?

-Integer: Whole numbers. -float: Decimal numbers. -Character: Textual data. -Date: Date and time information.

8.What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?

-Organize data and maintain its integrity. -Provide efficient data retrieval and manipulation. -Facilitate data sharing and collaboration among multiple users. -Ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access.
